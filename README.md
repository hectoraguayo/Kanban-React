# React Kanban Board with react-beautiful-dnd

This project is a simple implementation of a Kanban board developed in React, leveraging the react-beautiful-dnd library to facilitate drag-and-drop functionality. The Kanban board consists of multiple columns representing different stages of a workflow, and cards within each column are tasks that can be reorganized through the drag-and-drop action.

## Key Features:

Drag and Drop: Harnesses the powerful drag-and-drop functionality provided by react-beautiful-dnd to enable users to easily transition tasks between board columns.

Initial State with Mock Data: Initializes the board with sample data (mock data) to showcase functionality and provide a visual experience from the outset.
